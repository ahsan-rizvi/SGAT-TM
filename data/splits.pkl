The dataset is organized as a dictionary with the following keys:train_pos_1: A NumPy array of shape (, 2) representing the positive training examples. Each row contains a pair of feature values.test_pos_1: A NumPy array similar to train_pos_1, but containing the positive test examples.train_neg_1: A NumPy array of shape (, 2) representing the negative training examples.test_neg_1: A NumPy array similar to test_pos_1, but containing the negative test examples.Each value in the arrays is a pair of features (e.g., indices or positions) that will be used in the model for training and evaluation. The exact interpretation of these features will depend on the context of the dataset.Example:train_pos_1:[[1, 2], [1, 3], ... [2, 1], [6, 5]]Similarly for rest of the keys.
