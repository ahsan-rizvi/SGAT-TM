# SGAT-TM
Stacked Graph Attention Network with Temporal Modeling for lncRNA-miRNA Association Network

## Project Overview
The project involves the development and application of SGAT-TM to extract and analyze features from Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and micro RNAs (miRNAs). The objective is to train and test machine learning models using biological features to understand lncRNA-miRNA behavior and their potential roles in biological processes.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project is stored in a data directory and includes lncRNA and miRNA feautures for training and testing. These datasets contain arrays where each sample corresponds to different features. 

## Code Description
The code used in this project is stored in a code directory and includes:
* main.py: Entry point to train and evaluate the SGAT-TM model with customizable hyperparameters.
* model.py: Defines the SGAT-TM architecture combining self-attention, graph attention layers, GRU cell and MLP module.
* dataset.py: Loads .pkl data and prepares it for PyTorch models.
* funcs.py: Functions for metrics calculation and optional visualizations.
